While in school, I worked as an assistant at Heidiâ€™s Salon in Woodfield Mall where I learned a lot about coloring, toning & haircutting. I have been a hairstylist since 2005. I worked at an Aveda concept salon for 3 years before I opened Posh in 2008. I have taken numerous coloring, foiling, cutting & styling training courses. I am an expert colorist and specialize in foiling, foilayage & balayage. I stay up to date on trends & techniques. I offer a variety of services including coloring, foiling, haircuts, styling, facial waxing & hair extensions. I use high quality & non toxic products in my chemical free salon. </p></div>
